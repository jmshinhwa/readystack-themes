# BEM Class Auditor for HTML and SCSS

![BEM Class Auditor for HTML and SCSS](https://getreadystack.com/img/promo/sku9085_result_card.jpg)

**16 BEM naming rules read the HTML file you have open, and 22 markup and SCSS skeletons write the stylesheet shell — the class names get fixed before the pull request comes back for them.**

```html
<!-- what arrives in the pull request -->     <!-- what the convention asks for -->
<div class="cardTitle">                       <div class="card__title">
<div class="nav_link">                        <div class="nav__link">
<div class="card__body__title">               <div class="card__body-title">
<div class="modal--wide__panel">              <div class="modal__panel--wide">
```

Stylelint reads your stylesheet. Prettier reads your formatting. Neither one ever opens the class attribute in your HTML, which is exactly where a BEM name is born — so the drift gets caught by a person, in review, late.

## Free, with no licence key

- **Audit the open HTML file** against all 16 rules, every finding listed with its line number
- **Audit only the lines you selected**, block by block
- **Insert any of the 22 skeletons** at the cursor — 11 markup blocks and their 11 matching SCSS shells: card, nav, modal, form, table, tabs, accordion, alert, breadcrumb, pagination, hero
- **Read the full list** of the 16 rules and 22 skeletons that ship inside

One file is finished this way. Nothing is held back, watermarked or timed out.

## What a licence adds — $39 once

The paid commands change the **scope** of the same 16 rules, and give you something to **take away**:

- **Every HTML file in the repository, not only the one on screen.** Opens every file in the workspace and runs the same check on each, honouring your `max_files` and `exclude_glob` settings.
- **A findings file you can attach to the pull request.** Writes the findings as CSV, JSON or HTML into the workspace folder; it uses your `report_format` setting when one is set, and only asks which format when it is not.

A freelance front-end developer averaged **$73 an hour** in 2026, and the naming round is the one that repeats.
